# Format Paywall

## Description

This is a site created by The Format Group for use by ISCA (International School Counselors Association). The site is designed to better deliver electronic training materials to ISCA members, and ISCA material purchasers without the need for 3rd party software, file sending, or 3rd-party distribution fears.

The site is deployed using Render under Jesse Denier's personal account, and the domain is purchased through SquareSpace under Jesse Denier's Format account.
